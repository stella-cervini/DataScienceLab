# Forecasting Quality of Life: the Future of Nations
In an era characterized by unprecedented data availability and globalization, the quest to
objectively measure and estimate the quality of life across the globe has become increasingly
important. This is why we have chosen to address this topic in our Data Science Lab project.
The heart of this work is the ”Life Index”, a scalar metric that ranges from 0 to 1, which
serves as a compass to measure and delineate the quality of life within a given country. The
development of this Index is based on several data sources: political (stability and freedom),
economic (GDP) and demographic (population, birth rates and life expectancy).\
The essence of this project is not only to assess the present, but also to look into the
future: using historical data from the past 15 years, our research attempts to predict the
evolution of these crucial indicators, including the synthetic Life Index. Using **time series
analysis techniques**, we aspire to offer insights into how these indicators will develop, thus
providing a look into the future direction of nations around the world.\
Moreover, this research extends beyond the borders of individual nations: using **clustering methodologies**, we tried to uncover patterns and similarities between nations based on
these key indicators. In addition, we conducted data aggregations on a continental level,
revealing regional trends, disparities and opportunities.\
This project provides practical applications that have the potential to have an impact on
people’s lives. It is possible to image an online service, supported by a sustainable business
model, that allows users to identify countries that match their aspirations, both current and
future, whether for permanent residence, travel or investment
